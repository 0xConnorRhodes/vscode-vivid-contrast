# Vivid Contrast

I'm a fan of the VS code high contrast themes because they make it easy to see which one of your panes is currently selected. This is an opinionated implementation of a high contrast theme with somewhat reduced contrast and colors inspired by vim-vividchalk.

Inspiration:
1. [Nicer High Contrast](https://github.com/rafmsou/nicer-high-contrast)
2. [vim-vividchalk](https://github.com/tpope/vim-vividchalk)

### Install
